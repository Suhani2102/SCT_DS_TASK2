🚢 Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology. In this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the popular Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships related to survival outcomes.

📝 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides demographic and travel-related information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The objective of this task was to clean the data and analyze key variables to discover what factors most strongly influenced survival.

🎯 Objectives

•Perform data cleaning by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.

•Conduct exploratory data analysis using summary statistics and visualizations.

•Identify correlations between variables like age, fare, class, and survival.

•Strengthen understanding of EDA best practices in Python.

📁 Dataset Used

•Source: Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

•Fields: Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked, etc.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

•Filled missing Age values with the median age.

•Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive missing data.

•Filled missing Embarked values with the mode.

•Converted categorical variables into numerical form for analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

🔍 Univariate Analysis:

•Distribution of Age, Fare, and Survival counts.

•Class-wise and gender-wise distribution.

🧩 Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:

•Survival rate by Sex, Pclass, and Embarked.

•Correlation heatmap for numerical features.

•Distribution plots and bar charts with hue separation for insights.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
•Python

•Pandas – data manipulation

•Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

•NumPy – numerical operations

🔍 Key Insights

•Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

•Passengers in higher classes (Pclass=1) had better chances of survival.

•There is a mild positive correlation between fare paid and survival.

•Embarkation point also influenced survival in some cases.

🎓 Key Learnings

•Learned efficient data cleaning techniques.

•Strengthened EDA skills using real-world messy data.

•Improved ability to communicate insights visually.

•Practiced correlation analysis and feature interaction study.


🚀 What's Next?

Looking forward to upcoming tasks that further enhance my ability to work with real datasets and extract actionable insights. Stay tuned!
